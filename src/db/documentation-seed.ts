/**
 * What the nine stages ask for, as the Overseas team described it.
 *
 * This is the starting content, not a rule set frozen in code: every row lands
 * in document_requirements, where the team edits it, pauses it or adds to it.
 * Validity in months is only recorded where the requirement itself carries one
 * (a TB test is good for six months); where a document carries its own expiry,
 * the date is read off the document instead.
